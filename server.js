/*
Charlie's suggestion:
    1. Create the main menu
        - Import inquirer
        - Create a single prompt of type List
        - Make sure the answer is getting recorded properly
    2. Make sure that all the View routes work
        - View all employees == SELECT * FROM employee and then write to console (console.table)
        - View all departments ""
        - View all roles ""
    3. Figure out how to re-display the main menu

    4. Inserts
        - employee = INSERT INTO
